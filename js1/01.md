# Create descriptive variable names #1

## What are the characteristics of good variable names? Give an example.

- In Javascript, it is important to write a descriptive variable to help identify class vs variables/functions and const.
- The rule of thumb is to write variable names, function name and const in lowerCamelCase. For class, used in UpperCamelCase.

## What are some bad variable names and why?

- `var Chicago = 10;` It is not following syntax of lowerCamelCase nor is it descriptive to why it is storing 10 in it.
- `class something {};` It is a bad function name because it is not following the UpperCamelCase syntax and it is not descriptive of what the class will contain
- Any word that is reserved. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp)

[Example taken from node best practices.](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices#-36-naming-conventions-for-variables-constants-functions-and-classes)

```js
//for class name we use UpperCamelCase
class SomeClassExample {}

//for const names we use the const keyword and lowerCamelCase
const config = {
   key: 'value'
 };

//for variables and functions names we use lowerCamelCase
let someVariableExample = 'value';
function doSomething() {}
```
